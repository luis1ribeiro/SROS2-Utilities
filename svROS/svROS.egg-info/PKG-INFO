### svROS - Security Verification in ROS

The *Security Verification in ROS* (svROS) tool concerns a technique, based on the software verification perspective, to automatically verify system-wide properties related to the security configuration of ROS2-based applications. 

To that purpose it will model the ROS architecture, as well as the network communication behaviour, in Alloy, a formal specification language and analysis tool supported by a model-finder, with which system-wide properties will subsequently model-checked.

Enjoy! (ง ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)ง
