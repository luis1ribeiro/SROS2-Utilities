### Alloy - A Specification and Analysis Framework

Alloy 6 is a new major version. It features new keywords and symbols that allow to specify and assess behavioral models natively (rather than by modeling traces explicitly as in previous versions). It also features new solving techniques as well as an upgraded Visualizer. A full reference for the language is available here. Notice there are a few syntactic changes with respect to older versions of Alloy (see the bottom of this page).
